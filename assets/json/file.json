But there is a Chinese version of curry and it's one of the very popular dishes in Chinese takeout and restaurants, in the UK and United States.This Western-style Chinese curry sauce is very similar to Japanese curry roux and thicker, milder, and sweeter than Indian curries.

While, Indian curry pastes are made basically made from onions, tomatoes, and cream.",
